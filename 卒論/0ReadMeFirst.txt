dynamicDiscreteChoice.zipThis Zip archive contains a documented Matlab package for specifying, solving, simulating and estimating a basic firm entry and exit model along the lines of Dixit (1989). This package is used in the courses Empirical Industrial Organization II at CentER Tilburg (230323) and in the Finnish Doctoral Programme in Economics (SEIO11).

To start working with the package, unzip it and browse the Matlab code and its documentation indynamicDiscreteChoice.m.htmlBe warned that some browsers may, under default settings, only show the Matlab code and not its documentation. The complete document looks like an academic paper, with title, authors, table of contents, sections, and text surrounding the Matlab code. 

This package is work in progress and comments are welcome.
